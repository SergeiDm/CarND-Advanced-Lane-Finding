# CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding
## Project Description
The goal of the project is to detect lane lines on a road by processing video. The process of the video includes the following steps:
- Camera Calibration.
- Distortion Correction.
- Creating binary images.
- Perspective transform.
- Detection Lane Lines pixels.
- Determining the curvature of the lane and vehicle position.

## Project files
The project includes the following folder/files:
- camera_calibration â€“ the folder with Chess Board images for a camera calibration.
- test_images - the folder with image examples for testing pipeline.
- output_images - the folder with results of testing all steps of pipeline.
- Advanced_Lane_Finding_Solution.ipynb - the script with pipeline.
- challenge_video.mp4 - the video to test pipeline.
- output_challenge_video_1.mp4 - the result of pipeline work on 'challenge_video.mp4'.
- project_video.mp4 - the video to test pipeline.
The result of pipeline work on 'project_video.mp4' is https://youtu.be/y2oDu1P6vjw.
