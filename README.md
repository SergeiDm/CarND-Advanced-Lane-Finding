# CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding
Project Description
The project consists of learning network to map images, taken from a front-facing camera with steering angles. According to NVIDEA «End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars» this approach for self-driving cars may lead to better performance in comparison explicit decomposition of the self-driving problem.
Project files
My project includes the following files:
•	model.py – the script to create and train the model
•	drive.py – for driving the car in autonomous mode
•	model.h5 – the model weights
•	model.json – the model architecture
•	writeup_report.pdf – description of the model and the results
For testing autonomous driving the following code should be executed:
python drive.py model.json
